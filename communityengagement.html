            <h4>Nkamlikum Maths Project</h4>
            <p>The world is in the fourth industrial revolution and 
                my community lack personnel with the required digital skills
                to help the community reap the benefits which come with the fourth industrial revolution.
                This is because a lot students shy away from STEM majors. Less than 2 students in every 50 students 
                in my community consider studying computer science in high school because they do not understand mathematics.
    
                Alot of students always find it difficult to study computer science fields because of the mathematics content 
                In my community this was a major challenge which needed intervention.
                I have intervened in this by providing students with toll free classes so that they can
                be able to gain interest in mathematics and computer science. Additionally, I have given 
            out my textbooks which are based in STEM to this students and I have also galvanised efforts 
        to get text books from students who have already graduated from high school.

            <h4>Mbu Bakundu Development project</h4>
            <p>Mbu Bakundu village is a remote commmunity which has not got a road since its existence 
                 Almost every child in that community is ignorant of ICT. They do not even know that computers 
                 exists. This has been a challenge for several years. In order to solve this i championed a project 
                 which solicited for funds from
                 the Mastercard foundation to install a solar plate in the village.
                 After this installation was done, a computer and a tv were installed where children in that community
                 so that students can be exposed to basic ICT. We did this by using flash disk to install educative
                 programs on the computers and for them to watch on the tv.
