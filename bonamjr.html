            <div><h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My name is Bonam Osene, an applied computer technology student at United Stated International university - Africa. 
                I am in my junior year, and I am passionate about building software to improve human life. As a result of this passion, 
                I am concentrating on software engineering. Moreover, I am looking forward to adding the skills of machine learning and
                 artificial intelligence to the software engineering skills I currently possess. Away from academics, I am interested in
                 contributing positively to the development of my community by solving challenges which are faced in the community.
                  
                I also love to make things better and I find delight in changing the status quo of things when necessary. 
                I am results oriented,
                 and always seek to inspire those around 
                me to improve on the state of things or at least maintain a good standard in whatever we engage in.</p>

                <div id="right"> <h6>Nkamlikum Maths Project</h6>
                    <p>The world is in the fourth industrial revolution and 
                    my community lack personnel with the required digital skills
                    to help the community reap the benefits which come with the fourth industrial revolution.
                    This is because a lot students shy away from STEM majors. Less than 2 students in every 50 students 
                    in my community consider studying computer science in high school because they do not understand mathematics.
                    I have intervened in this by providing students with toll free classes so that they can
                    be able to gain interest in mathematics and computer science </p>

            <div id="left"><h6>Mbu Bakundu Development project</h6>
                <p>Mbu Bakundu village is a remote commmunity which has not got a road since its existence 
                     Almost every child in that community is ignorant of ICT. They do not even know that computers 
                     exists. This has been a challenge for several years. In order to solve this i championed a project 
                     which solicited for funds from
                     the Mastercard foundation to install a solar plate in the village.
                     After this installation was done, a computer and a tv were installed where children in that community
                     so that students can be exposed to basic ICT. We did this by using flash disk to install educative
                     programs on the computers and for them to watch on the tv.
